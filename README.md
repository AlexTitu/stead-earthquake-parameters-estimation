# Seismic Signals Analysis using Deep Neural Networks
Recent technological advances in parallel computing architectures and the advances of Deep Learning methods used in Seismology, have led to a recent wave of research in the field of seismic signal interpretation. Seismic signals contain a significant amount of information that can be extracted using classical empirical seismogram analysis procedures or using physical laws. The present work addresses the analysis of seismic signals from the perspective of information extraction starting directly from the data captured by the sensors, with the help of deep neural networks and time-frequency analysis. In this way, the characteristic parameters of the seismic sources recorded by only one seismograph sensor will be estimated. The performance metrics used in determining how well is the neural network performing in the task of estimating the seismic source parameters will be the mean squared error and the coefficient of determination (R2).
